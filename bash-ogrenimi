# Linux/Bash & Python Setup - Day 1

## 1. Command Line Fundamentals (CLI)

### A. Navigation and Inspection (Gezinme ve İnceleme)
- `pwd` (Shows the current directory/location)
- `ls` (Lists files and directories)
- `ls -al` (Detailed list, including hidden files)
- `cd <directory>` (Change Directory)
- `cd ..` (Moves up to the parent directory)

### B. File and Directory Management (Dosya ve Dizin Yönetimi)
- `mkdir <name>` (Creates a new directory)
- `rmdir <name>` (Removes an empty directory)
- `touch <filename>` (Creates an empty file)
- `rm <filename>` (Removes a file)
- `rm -r <directory>` (Recursively removes a directory and its contents)

### C. Copying, Moving, and Permissions (Kopyalama, Taşıma ve İzinler)
- `cp <source> <destination>` (Copies files or directories)
- `mv <source> <destination>` (Moves or renames files/directories)
- `sudo` (Executes a command with superuser/root privileges)
- `chown <user>:<group> <file>` (Changes file ownership)
- `chgrp <group> <file>` (Changes file group ownership)

## 2. Initial Python Setup
- Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
- System PATH configurations checked and verified.

## 3. Next Steps (Summary of Day's Progress)
- Tomorrow's Focus: Moving on to `if/else` control flow structures in Bash scripting.
