| `tar -xvf` | `tar -xvf archive.tar` | Extract Verbose File. Extracts and lists the files being processed. |

 2. I/O Redirection and Piping

| `2>>` | `command 2>> errors.log` | Redirects standard error output (stderr) and **appends** it to a file. |
| `|` | `ls -l | grep .sh` | Pipe. Sends the output of the first command as the input to the second command. |
| `grep` | `grep 'ERROR' logs.txt` | Filters file content to search for lines matching a specified pattern/string. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `cat` | `cat config.yaml` | Concatenates files; often used to display the **entire content** of a small file. |
| `more` | `more access.log` | Displays file content one screen at a time, allowing controlled viewing. |
| `head -n` | `head -n 10 file.txt` | Displays the **first 'n' lines** of a file. |
| `tail -n` | `tail -n 10 file.txt` | Displays the **last 'n' lines** of a file. (`tail -f` is used for real-time monitoring of growing logs). |

 4. User and Privilege Management

**Goal:** Essential security practices for managing access and running tasks with elevated permissions.

| Command | Usage / Example | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `sudo su` | `sudo su` | Switches to the **root** (superuser) user account. (Admin access). |
